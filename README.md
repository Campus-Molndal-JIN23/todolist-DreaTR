# Project name

Todolist


## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions 
as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

To create a TODO Application with a menu system that can handle TODOs and also testers for 
the application.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

To bring together all the knowledge we have learned during the course and show that we can create an 
application that uses tests to ensure that the application works as it should. The program must handle 
TODOs where you must be able to create, read out, edit and delete TODOs according to the CRUD principle. Our
TODOs must exist in a database, either MongoDB or SQLite. I chose MongoDB as the database.

- What problem does it solve?

It contributes to better design of the code, the code becomes testable and tested, you build in quality 
early and prevent poor quality. 

- What did you learn?

Writing robust tests for individual classes in a larger application and using GitHub Actions that allows you to automate
your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, 
or deploy merged pull requests to production.

## How to Contribute


## Tests

The project also includes test cases to verify proper functionality of the Todo class. The tests are contained in the 
TodoTest class and use the JUnit 5 framework.
To run the tests, JUnit 5 must be properly configured in the project and then run the test methods in the TodoTest
class.
